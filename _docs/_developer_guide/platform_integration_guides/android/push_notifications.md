# About push notifications

> With push notifications, you can re-engage your app users by sending time-sensitive and relevant content directly to their device screen&#8212;even if their app is closed. When you're finished integrating push for your app, be sure to check out our [push best practices]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/push/best_practices/).

{% alert important %}
If your Android push integration is already set up, and you're looking to migrate from Google's deprecated Cloud Messaging API, see [Migrating to the Firebase Cloud Messaging API]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/push_notifications/android/migrating_to_firebase_cloud_messaging).
{% endalert %}

## Push stories

No extra integration for Android Push Stories is required. It's built into Braze already! To learn more, see [Push Stories]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/push/advanced_push_options/push_stories/).
