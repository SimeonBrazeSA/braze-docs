# News Feed integration

> This article covers how to set up a News Feed for the tvOS platform.

{% alert note %}
News Feed is being deprecated. Braze recommends that customers who use our News Feed tool move over to our Content Cards messaging channelâ€”it's more flexible, customizable, and reliable. Check out the [migration guide]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/content_cards/migrating_from_news_feed/) for more.

## tvOS Feed integration

Our tvOS SDK supports fetching your News Feed data, such that you can display the News Feed in your application with your own custom UI. To fetch the News Feed, call the following methods and then parse each card by inspecting its class.

{% tab OBJECTIVE-C %}

```objc
NSArray *feedCards =  [[Appboy sharedInstance].feedController getNewsFeedCards];
```

{% endtab %}
{% tab swift %}

```swift
let feedCards = Appboy.sharedInstance()?.feedController.newsFeedCards
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
