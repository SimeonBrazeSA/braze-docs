# Using Shopify with Braze

> This page shows you how you can use the Shopify integration in Braze, such as in your campaigns, Canvases, segments, and how to disable checkout notifications in Shopify.

## Prerequisites

Review [Shopify standard itegration]({{site.baseurl}}/shopify_standard_integration/) for instructions on integrating your Shopify store before proceeding with this article.

## Disable abandoned checkout notifications in Shopify 

As you implement your Shopify use cases in Braze, ensure that you disable Shopify’s Abandoned Checkout notification. This will help you avoid sending duplicate emails to your customers.

### Steps to Disable Emails in Shopify:

1. Log into your Shopify admin panel.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Notifications**.
3. Disable the relevant notifications, such as abandoned checkout emails by doing the following:
4. Select the **Edit** button for each notification and uncheck the option to send these emails.
5. Save your changes.

{% alert important %}
Disable these emails right before you enable the corresponding flows in Braze. This will help you avoid any gaps in communication and faciliate a seamless transition to sending notifications through Braze.

## Message Personalization 

[Liquid]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/liquid/) is a powerful templating language used by Braze that allows you to create dynamic and personalized content for your customers. By using Liquid tags, you can customize messages based on customer data, product information, and other variables, enhancing the shopping experience and driving engagement.

### Key features of Liquid

- **Dynamic content:** Insert customer-specific information such as names, order details, and preferences into your messages.
- **Conditional logic:** Use if/else statements to display different content based on specific conditions (e.g., customer location, purchase history).
- **Loops:** Iterate over collections of products or customer data to display lists or grids of items.

### Getting started with Liquid

To begin personalizing your messages using Liquid tags, you can refer to the following resources:

- [Shopify data]({{site.baseurl}}/shopify_features/shopify_data/) reference with pre-defined liquid tags
- [Liquid]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/liquid/)
### Abandoned Cart and Abandoned Checkout product personalization {#abandoned-cart}

To dynamically add product information into your Abandoned Cart and Abandoned Checkout messages, you need to use the shopping cart Liquid tag like the one below.

{% raw %}
```json

```
{% endraw %}

{% alert tip %}
Use this shopping cart abort tag to avoid triggering a message to users without items in their cart.
{% endalert %}

## Segments

Use Braze [segments]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments#about-braze-segments) to create targeted customer segments based on specific attributes and behaviors, and deliver personalized messaging and campaigns through your Shopify integration. With this powerful feature, you can effectively engage your customers by reaching the right audience with the right message at the right time.

For more information on getting started with segments, check out [About Braze segments]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments#about-braze-segments).

### Shopify integration guidance  

To create a segment based on who has performed a supported event through the integration, you can use our Custom Event filters and specify the [specific event name]({{site.baseurl}}).

![][1]

To create a segment based on attributes supported through the integration, you can use Custom Attribute filters and specify the [attribute name](). 

![][2]

If you need to specify interactions with specific products, like who has placed an order for shoes, you can use one of the following options: 
- [Segment Extensions]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/segment_extension/#step-1-navigate-to-segment-extensions)
- [SQL Segment Extensions]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/sql_segments/#creating-sql-segment-extensions)

{% alert note %}
At this time, the Shopify integration doesn’t support populating the Braze [purchase event]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/purchase_events#purchase-events). As a result, purchase filters, Liquid tags, action-based triggered, and analytics should use the ecommerce.order_placed event. 
{% endalert %}

## Reporting 

Braze reporting features are designed to help you gain valuable insights into your customer engagement and marketing performance through your Shopify integration. You can track key metrics, analyze user behavior, and measure the effectiveness of your campaigns, all in one place.

### Shopify integration guidance  

To create a [Custom Events]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_events#analytics) report based on who has performed a supported event through the integration, you can specify the specific [event name]({{site.baseurl}}).

To gain insights into the trends related to orders placed from your launched Canvases, you will need to set up a [Conversions Dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/analytics/conversions_dashboard#conversions-dashboard) and specify your Canvases.

For more advanced reporting use cases, you can use the Braze [Query Builder]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/query_builder/) to generate custom reports. 

{% alert note %}
At this time, the Shopify integration doesn’t support populating the Braze [purchase event]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/purchase_events#purchase-events). As a result, purchase filters, Liquid tags, action-based triggered, and analytics should use the ecommerce.order_placed event.
