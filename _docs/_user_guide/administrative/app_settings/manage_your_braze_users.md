## What are the differences among teams, permission sets, and roles? 

You can use team, permission sets, and user roles to manage dashboard user access and responsibilities within Braze. Each feature encompasses a different collection of permissions and access-controls.

### Key differences

At a high level, each feature has a different scope:
- Permission sets control what dashboard users can do across all workspaces.
- Roles control what dashboard users can do in specific workspaces.
- Teams control the audiences that dashboard users can message.

| Feature | What you can do |
| - | - |
| [Permission sets]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/manage_your_braze_users/user_permissions/#creating-a-permission-set) | Bundle permissions related to specific subject areas or actions (such as for “Developers” and “Marketers”), then apply them to dashboard users who need the same permissions across different workspaces. |
| [Roles]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/manage_your_braze_users/user_permissions/#creating-a-role) | Bundle individual custom permissions and workspace-access controls into predefined roles (such as “Marketer - Fashion Brands” and “Marketer - Skincare Brands”), then assign a role to dashboard users to directly grant them the associated workspace access and permissions. |
| [Teams]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/manage_your_braze_users/teams/) | Limit dashboard user access to resources based on the audience (such as customer base location, language, and custom attributes). |
