# Onboarding

> Start your users' journey with this onboarding template. This template is designed to promote strong initial adoption and encourage lasting relationships with your users. By leveraging personalized communication and a structured set of messages, you can seamlessly introduce your users to your brand and initiate the beginning of a lasting relationship.

## Getting started

In this article, we'll walk you through a use case for the **Onboarding** template, which is intended for the consideration stage of the user lifecycle, to create a seamless onboarding journey for new users of your app PantsLabyrinth, a clothing retailer that offers innovative subscription plans. After this article, you'll have customized this Braze Canvas template with personalized messages for these new users.

As a member of the marketing team at PantsLabyrinth, your goal is on enhance user engagement, build trust and loyalty with your users, and encourage them to stay engaged with PantsLabyrinth. To do so, you want to focus on crafting messages that target new users who have yet to interact with PantsLabyrinth.

## Step 1: Assign your conversion events

Conversion events are a type of success metric that can be used to measure the success of the Canvas. The onboarding template has the following [conversion event]({{site.baseurl}}//user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/building_campaigns/conversion_events/#primary-conversion-event) to get you started.

So, new users have up to four days to perform the custom event. In this case, you want your new users to feel a sense of urgency to engage with PantsLabyrinth and subscribe to a recurring delivery on seasonal clothing.

## Step 2: Set an entry schedule

Because your goal is to target new users of PantsLabyrinth, you'll keep the Canvas as action-based and allow users who start a session in the app to enter the Canvas. However, you could further evaluate if a user has taken any specific actions such as making a purchase.

Adjust the **Entry Window** to determine when users can enter the Canvas. Because PantsLabyrinth has a late-October subscription launch, you'll set the start time as **2024/10/28 8:00 am** in the template. Optionally, you can also let users enter the Canvas in their local time zone.

## Step 3: Determine who enters the Canvas

By targeting the right audience, you can effectively engage with new users. For example, this template targets all users who first used an app less than one day ago.

## Step 4: Set your send settings

As a default template, this Canvas is sent to users who are subscribed or opted in and follows frequency capping rules. 

## Step 5: Personalize your onboarding messages

In the Canvas builder, this template prepares you with the following user journey over the duration of five days.

First, your users will receive an onboarding email. Whether your user engages with the email or not will help you further segment your audience.

### Customize your Audience Path

In the Audience Path, you can customizing the filter for your engaged users. In the template, this is **Has clicked email for step Welcome Email**, which means users are split into two groups: users who have opened the welcome email and those who haven't. 

As an online clothing retailer, PantsLabyrinth also has an active group of mobile users. So, in a separate onboarding Canvas, we can also select the following filter to identify and split your mobile users into these segments:

- **Has clicked content card for step Welcome Content Card**
- **Everyone Else**

## Step 6: Launch your Canvas

Be sure to test and preview your Canvas before launch. After this, you're ready to target your new users by launching this Canvas!
