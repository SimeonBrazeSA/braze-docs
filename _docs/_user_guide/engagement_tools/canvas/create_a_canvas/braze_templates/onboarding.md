# Onboarding

> Start your users' journey with this onboarding template. This template is designed to promote strong initial adoption and encourage lasting relationships with your users. By leveraging personalized communication and a structured set of messages, you can seamlessly introduce your users to your brand and initiate the beginning of a lasting relationship.

## Getting started

In this article, we'll walk you through a use case for the **Onboarding** template, which is intended for the consideration stage of the user lifecycle, to create a seamless onboarding journey for new users of your app PantsLabyrinth, a clothing retailer that offers innovative subscription plans. After this article, you'll have customized this Braze Canvas template with personalized messages for these new users.

As a member of the marketing team at PantsLabyrinth, your goal is on enhance user engagement, build trust and loyalty with your users, and encourage them to stay engaged with PantsLabyrinth. To do so, you want to focus on crafting messages that target new users who have yet to interact with PantsLabyrinth.

## Step 1: Assign your conversion events

Conversion events are a type of success metric that can be used to measure the success of the Canvas. The onboarding template has the following [conversion event]({{site.baseurl}}//user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/building_campaigns/conversion_events/#primary-conversion-event) to get you started.

So, new users have up to four days to perform the custom event. In this case, you want your new users to feel a sense of urgency to engage with PantsLabyrinth and subscribe to a recurring delivery on seasonal clothing.

## Step 2: Set an entry schedule

Because your goal is to target new users of PantsLabyrinth, you'll keep the Canvas as action-based and allow users who start session in the app to enter the Canvas.

However, you could further evaluate if a user has taken any specific actions such as making a purchase.

Adjust the **Entry Window** to determine when users can enter the Canvas. Because PantsLabyrinth has a late-September subscription launch, you'll keep the start time as **2024/09/20 8:00 am** in the template. Optionally, you can select for users to enter in their local time zone.

## Step 3: Determine who enters the Canvas



## Step 4: Adjust send settings



## Step 5: Personalize your onboarding messages



### Customize your audience path

In the audience path, you can customizing the filter for your engaged users. In the template, it's **Has clicked email for step Welcome Email**, which means users are split into two groups: users who have opened the welcome email and those who haven't. 

As an online clothing retailer, PantsLabyrinth also has an active group of mobile users. So, we could also select the following filter to identify and split our mobile users into these segments:

- **Has clicked content card for step Welcome Content Card**
- **Everyone Else**

## Step 6: Launch your Canvas

Be sure to test and preview your Canvas before launch. After this, you're ready to target your new users by launching this Canvas!

Consideration lifecycle stage

FakeBrandz: Kitchenrie aka ecommerce app 

General notes: 
- These templates do not include any company-specific content or references (e.g. segments, custom events, custom attributes, specific apps). 
- Customers will need to add these to tailor the templates to their unique needs
- In the same vein, customers will need to customize the message content to their brand and use case
- Welcome new users and make the great first impression and inspire a lasting relationship between them and your brand.
- In Audience Paths, consider customizing the proxy for engaged users. Here, itâ€™s email opens, but could consider key actions in their app/site

The ask: 
Let us create a step-by-step guide to create these use cases using the existing templates. Talk through why each choice was made and was important. Specifically call out which stage of the lifecycle the use case is best for, and any prerequisites needed (SDK integration, custom events named X, etc.). 

Use one of the FakeBrandz to provide context and real-world examples to your choice, giving more depth and specificity than what our pre-built templates offer. (Because these focus on eCommerce in these use cases, PantsLabyrinth and Kitchenerie are going to get a lot of love, but if it's not explicitly eCommerce try and use another brand for variety.) I recommend (but will not insist) also including the logos for your chosen FakeBrandz in the article for visual flair. 

From eCommerce use case:
- Welcome Series: A structured set of messages that introduce a user to a brand; sets them up for success; explains the value prop.
