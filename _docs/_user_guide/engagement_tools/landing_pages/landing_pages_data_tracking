# Landing Pages Data Tracking

## Overview:

Braze Landing Pages utilize a version of the Braze Web SDK to track user data only when a landing page form is submitted. Other information - not tied to a specific user - is collected without using the Web SDK, including pageviews and button click aggregate counts.

### Tracking Mechanisms:

Web SDK:
The Braze Web SDK is initialized only when a user submits a form on the landing page. This means that prior to form submission, no personal data is collected and the SDK does not actively track users. Once initialized, the SDK does not store any data in the browser (cookies, local storage, or otherwise).

- When a form is submitted, the SDK will collect the following datapoints:
- Form submission event (name of event and time of submission)
- Data specified by your team in the form (e.g - Name, Email, phone number)
- Session start time
- Device ID (unique ID generated - but not stored - for the device)
- Country determined by IP Address

### Anonymized Data:
Before a user submits a form, the data tracked on a landing page consists solely of anonymized, non-identifiable information. This includes standard website tracking metrics like the number of page views (impressions) and clicks that a landing page receives.
Since this data is not linked to identifiable users, it cannot be used for retargeting or tracking of individual user behavior.

## Impact on User Tracking and Cookie Consent:

Landing pages were built with an intent to adhere to privacy regulations, but we still recommend reviewing the above information with your legal team to determine if there are any consent collection mechanisms required for your company and use cases. 
By relying on local storage and anonymized data collection, Braze Landing Pages can operate without requiring explicit cookie consent from users prior to form submission as of now.

Checkbox form components will be added to landing pages soon, thus allowing more flexibility when there is a requirement for opt-in consent when there are more strict requirements in place regarding overall SDK usage.
