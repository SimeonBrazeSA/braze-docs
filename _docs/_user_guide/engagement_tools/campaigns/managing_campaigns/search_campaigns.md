# Searching for campaigns

> This article covers how you can use the search field of the campaigns list to refine your results.

## Filters

Use the filters in the side menu to group results by creator, editor, send dates, or channel, or select **Only Show Mine** to limit your search results to campaigns you've created. You can also filter by status and [tags]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/manage_app_group/tags/) to further narrow down your results.

Expand the search dropdown to filter by last editor, target segment, messaging channel, or date.
