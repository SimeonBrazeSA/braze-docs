  - name: "Bounces"
    description: The total number of messages that were unsuccessfully delivered to the intended recipients. This could occur because the email addresses were incorrect or deactivated. There are two types of <br>bounces:<br><br> -<b>Hard Bounces</b>&#58; A hard bounce is when an email fails to deliver to the recipient due to a permanent delivery error. A hard bounce might occur because the domain name doesn't exist or because the recipient is unknown. If an email receives a hard bounce, we will stop any future requests to this email address. <br><br>-<b>Soft Bounces</b>&#58; A soft bounce is when an email fails to deliver to the recipient due to a temporary delivery error, even though the recipientâ€™s email address is valid. A soft bounce might occur because the recipient's inbox is full, the server was down, or the message was too large for the recipient's inbox. If an email receives a soft bounce, we will usually retry within 72 hours, but the number of retry attempts varies from receiver to receiver. <br><br> You can view your hard and soft bounces in the <a href='/docs/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/developer_console/message_activity_log_tab/#message-activity-log-tab'>Message Activity Log</a>. <br><br><i> An email bounce for customers using SendGrid consists of hard bounces, spam, and emails sent to invalid addresses. </i>

Note that a user can also open an email (such as the open counts toward <i>Other Opens</i>) before a <i>Machine Opens</i> count is logged. If a user opens an email once (or more) after a machine open event from a non-Apple Mail inbox, then the amount of times that the user opens the email is calculated toward <i>Other Opens</i> and only once toward <i>Unique Opens</i>.
    calculation: Count
  - name: "Click to Open Rate"
    description: The percentage of unique emails opened that have been clicked at least once.
